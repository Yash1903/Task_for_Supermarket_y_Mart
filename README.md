To implement the supermarket application in C, combining the warehouse and customer desk functionalities while using text files for the database, we need to structure the program to handle reading from and writing to files for data persistence. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:

1.Warehouse Desk: Allows adding and updating items.
2.Customer Desk: Allows generating bills, updating stock, and generating reports.


To implement the supermarket application in C, combining the warehouse and customer desk functionalities while using text files for the database, we need to structure the program to handle reading from and writing to files for data persistence. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:

Warehouse Desk: Allows adding and updating items.
Customer Desk: Allows generating bills, updating stock, and generating reports.

Explanation:
Data Structures:

Item: Represents an item in the warehouse.
Customer: Represents a customer and their purchases.
File Operations:

loadWarehouse(): Loads warehouse data from a text file.
saveWarehouse(): Saves warehouse data to a text file.
loadCustomers(): Loads customer data from a text file.
saveCustomers(): Saves customer data to a text file.
Warehouse Desk:

addItem(): Adds a new item to the warehouse, with the option to add more items.
updateItem(): Updates the quantity and MRP of an existing item based on the HSN code.
Customer Desk:

generateBill(): Generates a bill for a customer by allowing them to add items continuously. Updates the warehouse stock accordingly.
generateReport(): Generates a report of sales, showing the remaining items in the warehouse and all customers' bill reports.
Main Loop: Provides a menu-driven interface to access the different functionalities of the application.

This program uses text files to maintain persistence across runs and supports multiple customers and warehouse operations.
Adjustments can be made as needed for more complex requirements or constraints.
